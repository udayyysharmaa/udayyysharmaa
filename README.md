<h1 align="left">Excutive Profile:</h1>
<p>My technical skills and project experience, I hold a B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering from AKTU, Gr. Noida, with a 7.2 SGPA. I have also completed my XII (Senior Secondary) from UP Board, Greater Noida Uttar Pradesh, with 81.8%, and X (Secondary) from UP Board, Greater Noida Uttar Pradesh, with 81.3%. Furthermore, I have achieved the AZ-900 certification, demonstrating proficiency in Azure fundamentals and cloud concepts, and I have been responsible for delivering end-to-end technical assistance across a wide range of systems and platforms. My role has primarily focused on providing 24x7 IT support, managing service requests and incidents, and ensuring the smooth operation of IT infrastructure for both Windows and Linux environments.

One of my core responsibilities has been working with the ServiceNow ticketing system to manage and resolve incidents and service requests. I handle incoming tickets, prioritize them based on urgency and impact, and ensure timely resolution in accordance with service level agreements (SLAs). I have consistently exceeded performance targets, resolving over 95% of tickets within the first 24 hours, surpassing the companyâ€™s benchmark of 85%. This has significantly contributed to improved user satisfaction and operational efficiency.

In addition to ticket management, I provide remote technical support using tools such as TeamViewer and ConnectWise. These tools enable me to access user systems securely and troubleshoot issues ranging from software errors and system crashes to network connectivity problems. My ability to diagnose and resolve issues remotely has helped reduce the need for on-site support and has improved response times across the board.

A significant part of my role involves user offboarding and asset management. When an employee is terminated or leaves the organization, I am responsible for collecting their hardware assets, including laptops and desktops. I initiate a secure device freeze to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that sensitive data is protected. I also coordinate with users and internal teams to facilitate the return of hardware to the office. Once the hardware is received, I perform data retrieval, account deactivation, and secure data deletion to maintain compliance with company policies and data protection regulations.

In cases of immediate termination, I act swiftly upon receiving email notifications. I prioritize these requests, initiate device freezes, and disable user accounts to prevent any potential data breaches. This process is critical to maintaining the integrity and security of the organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure.

My role also involves collaborating with team members during live support calls. I actively assist colleagues with complex troubleshooting scenarios, ticket escalations, and technical guidance. This collaborative approach has helped foster a strong team environment and ensures that support is delivered efficiently and effectively.

I have also contributed to process improvement initiatives within the IT support function. By analyzing recurring issues and identifying root causes, I have implemented proactive maintenance procedures that have led to a 30% reduction in system downtime. These improvements have not only enhanced system reliability but also increased overall productivity and user satisfaction.

To further streamline operations, I developed and implemented a centralized project management platform that improved communication between engineering and support teams. This platform enabled better task tracking, resource allocation, and project visibility, resulting in a 25% increase in project completion efficiency.</p>
